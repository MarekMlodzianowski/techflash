# Techflash Workspace

## Start Techflash App

nx serve techflash
```

This will start the `techflash` app on the default port.

## Start Node-API App

To start the `node-api` app, run the following command:

```sh
nx serve node-api
```

## Purpose of Shared-Types Library

The `shared-types` library is used to share TypeScript types between the `techflash` app and the `node-api` app. This ensures type consistency across both applications and reduces code duplication.
